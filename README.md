# StarDataCapture
## A Novel Method for Analyzing Images in Space

## Background
StarDataCapture is a resource that collects and organizes data from any .fits image of space. It can identify stars
and print the characteristics of every star.

## Installation
Here are my objectives.

## Results
After running the code through your image, you should be left with a list with the coordinates, the average
brightness of the star located, the average brightness of the background around it, the ratio between them for
each star, and a plot of every located star on top of the image you imported.
